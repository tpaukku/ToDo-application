# from django.test import TestCase

# Create your tests here.
# Test case ideas:
# create two users and two todos to each
# user who is not authenticated can not see any of these (and gets) 403
# authenticated user gets only list of own todos
# authenticated user gets only own todos detail view
# test creation, update, delete
# trying to access id which does not exists returns 404
